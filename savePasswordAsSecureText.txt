open powershell command line and then enter the first command and save to location
> read-host 'Enter Password' -assecurestring | convertfrom-securestring | out-file C:\Path\to\location\cred.txt

Once we have our password safely stored away, we can draw it back into our scripts
>$password = get-content C:\Path\to\location\cred.txt | convertto-securestring

Then finally, we can create our credential object, which we pump into other cmdlets.
>$credentials = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist "myusername",$pass
